# Kotlin Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with Kotlin-specific content.
>
> **STATUS: advisory, NOT wired** — no global hook runs any of these. `~/.claude/settings.json` registers no formatter/linter for this language, so nothing below happens automatically. Treat it as the checklist to configure per project, not a description of what already runs.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **ktfmt/ktlint**: Auto-format `.kt` and `.kts` files after edit
- **detekt**: Run static analysis after editing Kotlin files
- **./gradlew build**: Verify compilation after changes
