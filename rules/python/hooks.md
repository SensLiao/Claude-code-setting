# Python Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with Python specific content.
>
> **STATUS: advisory, NOT wired** — no global hook runs any of these. `~/.claude/settings.json` registers no formatter/linter for this language, so nothing below happens automatically. Treat it as the checklist to configure per project, not a description of what already runs.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **black/ruff**: Auto-format `.py` files after edit
- **mypy/pyright**: Run type checking after editing `.py` files

## Warnings

- Warn about `print()` statements in edited files (use `logging` module instead)
