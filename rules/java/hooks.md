# Java Hooks

> This file extends [common/hooks.md](../common/hooks.md) with Java-specific content.
>
> **STATUS: advisory, NOT wired** — no global hook runs any of these. `~/.claude/settings.json` registers no formatter/linter for this language, so nothing below happens automatically. Treat it as the checklist to configure per project, not a description of what already runs.

## PostToolUse Hooks

Configure in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

- **google-java-format**: Auto-format `.java` files after edit
- **checkstyle**: Run style checks after editing Java files
- **./mvnw compile** or **./gradlew compileJava**: Verify compilation after changes
