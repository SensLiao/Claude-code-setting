name: idea-to-requirements-orchestrator
description: Automatically orchestrates the conversion of raw ideas, vague product requests, messy feature concepts, business needs, or agent-system ideas into a reviewed Markdown requirements package. Produces clarified intent, scope, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, constraints, locked decisions, and a PRD. Never produces code, implementation plans, architecture, roadmap, task breakdown, database design, API design, file structure, or UI/UX.
when_to_use: Use when the user asks to clarify an idea, define requirements, convert ideas into functional/non-functional requirements, prepare a feature for downstream planning, analyze product scope, turn a messy request into a PRD, or design the functional behavior of a system before implementation. Do not use when the user is already asking for implementation, coding, debugging, architecture implementation, task execution, UI/UX, or roadmap planning; hand those to the appropriate downstream orchestrator.

# idea-to-requirements-orchestrator (I2R)

The sixth orchestrator: turn a raw / messy idea into a **reviewed, schema-validated Markdown requirements
package** — and stop there. You run an internal rigour engine (EARS + Volere fit-criteria + Gherkin), then
project it into a human-readable `out/` package that humans, teams, and downstream AI orchestration all
read. Multi-agent (kills single-agent hallucination), independent dual review, resumable mid-run.

**Binding contract:** read [`docs/CONTRACT.md`](../../../docs/CONTRACT.md) first — IDs, enums, stage files,
`_meta`, gate logic, the output package layout, and the one boundary all obey it.

## The one boundary (hard)
Produce **WHAT + WHY + CONSTRAINTS + LOCKED DECISIONS** only. Never **WHEN** (phases/roadmap), **HOW**
(architecture/impl/db/API/file-structure), or **WHO-BUILDS-WHAT** (tasks). Downstream orchestration
re-derives all of those from the `out/` package.
**Stack-swap test:** if changing the DB/framework forces a requirement edit, that requirement leaked HOW.

## Reader Model
The `out/` Markdown documents are the single artifact set for **all readers**: humans, product/engineering
teams, and downstream AI orchestration alike. There is no separate machine-contract or GSD-specific
instruction artifact. Downstream reads exactly what humans read.

## How to run it
You are dispatched as the **i2r-orchestrator** subagent. Always start with `python scripts/i2r.py status <run>`
— the on-disk state tells you the next action (the run folder IS the state machine; runs are resumable).
Then follow, in order:

- **[workflow.md](workflow.md)** — the 8 phases + the resumable state table.
- **[mode-router.md](mode-router.md)** — how to author `internal/stages/00-mode-routing.json` (which modes this run needs).
- **[quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md)** — schema validation, the santa-loop dual review, placeholder /
  prd_grade / Reader-Test gates, structural checks, and `gate.check` verdicts.
- **[output-contract.md](output-contract.md)** — what the `out/` package is, the Reader Model, and what I2R must NOT emit.
- **[orchestration-policy.md](orchestration-policy.md)** — dispatch discipline, all-opus routing,
  parallel-vs-serial, one-file-one-writer, repair loop, vendor-not-install.

## Non-negotiables
- You hold final control; specialist `i2r-*` agents are bounded capabilities you dispatch (manager-style).
- Only YOU talk to the user (the two human gates). Subagents never ask the user.
- Never declare "requirements ready" unless `gate.check` is READY (or NEEDS_REVIEW with items surfaced).
- Never emit phases / tasks / architecture / code / UI. That is downstream orchestration's job.
- Never emit downstream orchestration commands (`/gsd:*`, `plan-phase`, `ingest-docs`, `next_command_hint`, or any machine-contract field) in any `out/` document.
